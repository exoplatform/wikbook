Wikbook is a set of tools for efficiently writing docbook documentation. For this purpose several choices have been
made that are explained below

* The Docbook system can produce high quality documents with different outputs.
* Documentation written in wiki language is a good trade off between document richness and simplicity

Wikbook aims also to provide exclusive features that makes documentation easier to write. The perfect example we like
 to give is the inclusion of Java^^tm^^ source code at the heart of the documentation as it allows to have always up to
 date example that stay in sync with the documentation. The goal is to make the documentation easier to write and maintain.

Wikbook is also a lab to experiment new things and we are sure that it will get richer over time. We hope that people
will find Wikbook interesting to write their documentation, experiment new ideas and contribute them.

Wikbook aims to be open and does not want to lock users into a proprietary system. The proof is that Wikbook is based on the
open Docbook format.
